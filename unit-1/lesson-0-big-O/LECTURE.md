# Lesson: Algorithm Analysis

## Essential Questions

- What is an algorithm?
- How do we measure the efficiency of an algorithm?
- Why is it important to assess how an algorithmâ€™s runtime grows in relation to the size of its input?
- What are common algorithm runtimes and how do they describe how and which algorithms are associated with them?

## Key Terms

- Big-O Notation
- Runtime complexity
- O(_n_) - linear time
- O(_n_<sup>2</sup>) - quadratic time
- O(log _n_) - log time
- O(_n_ \* log _n_) time
- O(_n_!) - factorial time

## Practice

1. **Video: [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL8X2mlNHPM)**.
2. **Codecademy**: **[Pass the Technical Interview Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-javascript)**, just the Asymptotic Notation section.
3. **Reading**: **[Cracking the Coding Interview](<http://englishonlineclub.com/pdf/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%20-%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions%20(6th%20Edition)%20[EnglishOnlineClub.com].pdf>) Chapter 6 (Chapter VI); pages 38 - 45 (Stop at Examples and Exercises).** The code examples are in Java. You do not have to do them, but you should understand the **concepts**
